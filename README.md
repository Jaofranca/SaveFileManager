# SaveFileManager
Manage your save files from games on google drive folders more easily

### **Why i made this software?**

>I've always wanted to have all my save files from games i play in every machine that i use, i don't really like onedrive so i did this to automatize everything

## TO DO'S

- [x] Save the user configs on a json or something similar to make this process simpler.
- [ ] Use the json file so the user wont need to select the game folder everytime the application is open
- [ ] Watch the game save folder for changes on the files so that it will automatically upload to the cloud.
- [ ] Find a way to upload to different services, not just google drive.
- [ ] Use a backup folder on the cloud for each so that if errors occur it doesn't ruin the player save files.
- [ ] Options for the user to be able to select stuff that he wants (like automatic upload to the cloud).
- [ ] Find a way to automatically open this application when the user starts a game ( i think this will be the hardest one) .
